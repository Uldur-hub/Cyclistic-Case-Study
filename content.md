# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
!

# Introduction

Welcome to my Google Data Analytics Case Study.
My name is Hugo and in this project, I will take on the role of a Junior Data Analyst on the marketing analytics team at a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. The objective of this case study is to analyze historical trip data to identify behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members. These insights will inform the development of a targeted marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, thereby increasing the company's overall revenue.

The analysis will be conducted using SQL, and Tableau, and will follow Googleâ€™s six-step data analysis process: ***Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.***
